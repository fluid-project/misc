By turns dazzling and dark, dignified and frivolous, steamy-hot and icy-cold, Montreal - city of a thousand spires, crossroads of a continent - casts its eternal spell. Like a tune that lingers in the mind, its history speaks to the hearts of all: Montrealers, people experiencing its charm for the first time, and those who just keep coming back. The McCord Museum's permanentexhibition, entitled 
<em>
<strong>
Simply Montréal
</strong>
</em>
, offers myriad glimpses of this unique city and immerse visitors into the very heart of the rich and varied experience it offers.
<br/>
<br/>
An array of First Nations objects, full of symbolism and emotion; a selection of extraordinary photographs by the renowned Canadian photographer William Notman; a variety of sports equipment and charming toys; a series of splendid gowns and outfits worn by illustrious Montrealers - over 
<strong>
800 objects
</strong>
from the McCord's famous collection will bring the great Montreal adventure to life.
<br/>
<br/>
Accented with interactive installations and enveloped in evocative atmospheres, 
<em>
<strong>
Simply Montréal
</strong>
</em>
is an invitation to people of all ages to steep themselves in the city, surround themselves with its sounds and sensations - even to brave an authentic "made in Montreal" snowstorm!
